# Clinician Summary

Last updated: 2026-02-12

This page is a concise, clinician-facing summary extracted from project notes.
Use original reports for diagnostic decisions.

## Imaging Snapshot
- CT head (non-contrast) summary from notes:
  - "No acute intracranial abnormality."
  - Mild age-related atrophy.
  - Mild chronic white matter changes (described as age-consistent in notes).

## Longitudinal Watchlist (Oct 2024 to Feb 2026)
- Glycemic variability:
  - A1c trend captured as 7.3 -> 6.4 -> 7.3.
  - Random glucose spike documented at 247 mg/dL (Feb 2026).
- Micronutrient excess concerns:
  - Vitamin B12 documented as >1,500 pg/mL (Feb 2026).
  - Vitamin D documented as persistently >100 ng/mL (reported up to >120 ng/mL).
- Renal trend concern:
  - eGFR trend reported as 87 -> 87 -> 70 mL/min/1.73m2.

## Active Care Questions
- Confirm age/comorbidity-appropriate A1c and BP targets.
- Review medication/supplement interactions and supplement dose safety.
- Confirm follow-up strategy for prior autoimmune hepatitis/variceal history.
- Evaluate cognitive symptoms with reversible-cause screen (sleep, thyroid, B12, mood, medication effects).
