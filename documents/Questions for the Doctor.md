General Questions

Questions for the Doctor:



Given my history of CABG and Type 1.5 diabetes, are my current A1C and blood pressure targets where they should be?



Are there any potential interactions between my supplements (Iron, D3, Centrum Silver) and my prescriptions?



Should we schedule any follow-up imaging or labs for the Autoimmune Hepatitis or Stomach Varices, even though they are in remission/healed?

Detailed question

The following are proposed topics for discussion with the physician:



I. Cardiovascular Risk and Metabolic Targets

Review of Therapeutic Goals Post-CABG and with LADA: Given the specific medical history, including Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA, or Type 1.5 diabetes), a confirmation of optimal therapeutic goals is requested.

What are the current, evidence-based recommendations for A1C (Glycated Hemoglobin) targets for a patient with both post-CABG status and Type 1.5 diabetes? A determination of whether current results fall within this optimal range and if stricter or more flexible control should be pursued is sought.

Are the current blood pressure targets (Systolic and Diastolic) appropriate for minimizing long-term cardiovascular risk and ensuring renal protection, considering the concurrent diagnosis of diabetes?

II. Medication and Supplement Review

Assessment of Potential Drug and Supplement Interactions: A review of all prescription medications in conjunction with current over-the-counter supplements—specifically Iron, Vitamin D3, and a daily Centrum Silver multivitamin—is requested.

Could the complete regimen be reviewed for any potential pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions? This assessment should include potential effects on the absorption, metabolism, or efficacy of both the prescription medications and the supplements.

Specifically, does the Iron supplement or multivitamin interfere with the absorption or effectiveness of any medications prescribed for diabetes, hypertension, or other co-morbid conditions?

III. Autoimmune and Gastrointestinal Follow-Up

Surveillance Strategy for Autoimmune Hepatitis and Esophageal/Stomach Varices: While the Autoimmune Hepatitis is currently in remission and the Stomach Varices (presumably secondary to portal hypertension) have been documented as healed or resolved, long-term surveillance is often indicated for these conditions.

Should a formal, scheduled plan for follow-up imaging (e.g., ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), FibroScan) be established to monitor the liver for signs of disease recurrence or progression (e.g., cirrhosis)?

What specific laboratory tests (e.g., liver function tests, autoantibodies, complete blood count) are recommended, and at what frequency, to ensure the stability of the Autoimmune Hepatitis and to check for any asymptomatic changes in the status of the healed varices?

IV. Lifestyle and Nutritional Management

Optimizing Management for Type 1.5 Diabetes and Vitamin B12 Levels: Specific, actionable recommendations regarding lifestyle modifications to support health management are requested.

What specific dietary adjustments—beyond general healthy eating guidelines—are recommended to better manage the unique autoimmune component of Type 1.5 diabetes (LADA) and enhance blood glucose stability? Should the focus be on specific macronutrient ratios, meal timing, or the inclusion of specific anti-inflammatory foods?

Are there any particular exercise regimens or physical activity guidelines that are most beneficial for the management of Type 1.5 diabetes while maintaining safety given the history of a CABG procedure?

Given the history of Vitamin B12 deficiency (which may be associated with autoimmune conditions such as LADA or pernicious anemia), are additional interventions, monitoring, or dietary modifications necessary to ensure B12 levels remain within the optimal, rather than merely "normal," reference range?

-----General Inquiries Regarding Cognitive Concerns



Describing the Symptoms

When were the initial changes in memory observed, and what has been the nature of their progression?

Could specific examples of memory deficits be provided (e.g., forgetting recent conversations, misplacing items, difficulty performing familiar tasks)?

Are there any co-occurring symptoms, such as alterations in mood, personality, sleep patterns, or difficulties with language or executive planning?

Do the changes appear to be constant, or are there specific times of day or week when they are exacerbated or improved?

Medical History and Etiologic Factors

Is it plausible that any current medications or supplements are contributing to the observed memory issues?

Have there been any recent infections, injuries, or significant stressful life events that could potentially impact memory function?

Could these symptoms be related to underlying conditions such as sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12), or clinical depression?

What specific diagnostic tests (e.g., comprehensive blood work, medical imaging, cognitive assessments) are recommended to aid in determining the etiology?

Diagnosis and Future Management

What are the most probable diagnoses for these changes in cognitive function?

If a specific cause is identified, what are the available treatment modalities?

Should a cognitive impairment be suspected, what resources are available for the patient and their family (e.g., specialist referrals, support groups)?

What lifestyle modifications (e.g., dietary changes, exercise prescriptions, brain-stimulating activities) are recommended for the maintenance of cognitive health?



Memory

Here are some general questions she can ask her doctor about her memory concerns:



Describing the Symptoms

When did you first notice changes in your memory, and how have they progressed?

Can you describe specific examples of memory problems (e.g., forgetting recent conversations, misplacing items, difficulty with familiar tasks)?

Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as changes in mood, personality, sleep patterns, or difficulty with language or planning?

Do the changes seem constant, or are there times of the day/week when they are better or worse?

Medical History and Contributing Factors

Could any of my current medications or supplements be contributing to my memory issues?

Have I recently had any infections, injuries, or stressful life events that might be affecting my memory?

Could this be related to conditions like sleep apnea, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies (like B12), or depression?

Are there specific tests (blood work, imaging, cognitive assessments) you recommend to help determine the cause?

Diagnosis and Next Steps

What are the most likely reasons for these memory changes?

If a specific cause is identified, what are the treatment options?

If a cognitive impairment is suspected, what resources are available for me and my family (e.g., specialists, support groups)?

What lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, brain-stimulating activities) do you recommend for maintaining cognitive health?
